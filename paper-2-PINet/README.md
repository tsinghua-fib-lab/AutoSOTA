This repository contains a [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) implementation of &Pi;net, an output layer for neural networks that ensures the satisfaction of specified convex constraints.

> [!NOTE]
> **TL;DR:**
> &Pi;net leverages operator splitting for rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function theorem for backpropagation. It offers a *feasible-by-design* optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems to obtain modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems.

## Getting started
To install &Pi;net, run:
- CPU-only (Linux/macOS/Windows)
  ```bash
  pip install pinet-hcnn
  ```

## Examples

# Constraints & Projection Layer
All tensors are **batched**. Let `B` = batch size (you may use `B=1` to broadcast across a batch).

- Vectors: shape `(B, n, 1)`
- Matrices: shape `(B, n, d)`

## EqualityConstraint — enforce `A @ x == b`

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from pinet import EqualityConstraint

B, n_eq, d = 4, 3, 5
A = jnp.zeros((1, n_eq, d))         # (1, n_eq, d)  # broadcast across batch
b = jnp.zeros((B, n_eq, 1))         # (B, n_eq, 1)

eq = EqualityConstraint(
    A=A,
    b=b,
    method=None,                    # let Project decide / lift later
    var_b=True,                     # b provided per-batch at runtime
    var_A=False,                    # A constant (broadcasted)
)
```

> [!WARNING]
> **`method=None`**: `eq.project()` is only available if `method="pinv"`.
> When you have multiple constraints and you plan on using the equality constraint only within the projection layer, you can leave `method=None` (as above).

## AffineInequalityConstraint — enforce `lb ≤ C @ x ≤ ub`

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from pinet import AffineInequalityConstraint

n_ineq = 7
C  = jnp.zeros((1, n_ineq, d))      # (1, n_ineq, d)
lb = jnp.full((B, n_ineq, 1), -1.0) # (B, n_ineq, 1)
ub = jnp.full((B, n_ineq, 1),  1.0) # (B, n_ineq, 1)

ineq = AffineInequalityConstraint(C=C, lb=lb, ub=ub)
```

> [!WARNING]
> **`ineq.project()` intentionally `NotImplemented`**: To improve the efficiency of the projection, we always "lift" the affine inequality constraints as described in the paper. For this, we did not even bother implementing the projection method for this type of constraints 🤗.

## BoxConstraint — clip selected dimensions

```python
import numpy as np
import jax.numpy as jnp
from pinet import BoxConstraint, BoxConstraintSpecification

lb_x = jnp.full((B, d, 1), -2.0)    # (B, d, 1)
ub_x = jnp.full((B, d, 1),  2.0)    # (B, d, 1)
mask = np.ones(d, dtype=bool)       # apply to all dims (use False to skip dims)

box = BoxConstraint(BoxConstraintSpecification(lb=lb_x, ub=ub_x, mask=mask))
# box.project(...) clips x[:, mask, :] into [lb_x, ub_x].
```

## Combine constraints with `Project` (Douglas–Rachford)

`Project` handles:
- **Lifting** inequalities into equalities + auxiliary variables;
- Optional **Ruiz equilibration**;
- JIT-compiled forward;
- Optional custom VJP for backprop.

```python
from pinet.project import Project
from pinet.dataclasses import ProjectionInstance
import jax.numpy as jnp

proj = Project(
    eq_constraint=eq,              # can be None
    ineq_constraint=ineq,          # can be None
    box_constraint=box,            # can be None
    unroll=False,                  # use custom VJP path by default
)

# Build a ProjectionInstance with the point to project and (optionally) runtime specs:
x0 = jnp.zeros((B, d, 1))
yraw = ProjectionInstance(x=x0)
# If var_b=True and you supply per-batch b at runtime, pass it via your dataclass, e.g.:
# yraw = yraw.update(eq=yraw.eq.update(b=b))

y, sK = proj.call(       # JIT-compiled projector
    yraw=yraw,
    n_iter=50,                    # Douglas-Rachford iterations
    n_iter_backward=100,          # Maximum number of iterations for the bicgstab algorithm
    sigma=1.0, omega=1.7,
)

# If you want to resume the projection with the latest governing sequence sK,
# you can provided to the call method via s0=sK.

cv = proj.cv(y)  # (B, 1, 1) max violation across constraints
                 # The CV can also be assessed for the different constraints separately,
                 # e.g., eq.cv(y), if eq is a constraint for y
                 # (shapes need to match, so be careful of lifting!)
```

### Notes
- **Batch rules:** For each pair of tensors `(X, Y)`, either batch sizes match or one is `1` (broadcast).
- **Equality `method`:** Use `method="pinv"` when you rely on the equality projector standalone. When used inside `Project`, you can keep `method=None`; lifting will set up the pseudo-inverse internally.
- **Dimensions after lifting:** If inequalities are present, the internal lifted dimension is `d + n_ineq` (auxiliary variables).

# Minimal “Toy MPC” Application

The helper below wires the projector into a Pinet model; the loss is your batched objective.

```python
# benchmarks/toy_MPC/model.py
import jax.numpy as jnp
from flax import linen as nn
from pinet import BoxConstraint, BoxConstraintSpecification, EqualityConstraint
from src.benchmarks.model import build_model_and_train_step, setup_pinet

def setup_model(rng_key, hyperparameters, A, X, b, lb, ub, batched_objective):
    activation = getattr(nn, hyperparameters["activation"])
    if activation is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown activation: {hyperparameters['activation']}")

    # Constraints (b varies at runtime; A is constant & broadcasted)
    eq  = EqualityConstraint(A=A, b=b, method=None, var_b=True)
    box = BoxConstraint(BoxConstraintSpecification(lb=lb, ub=ub))
    project, project_test, _ = setup_pinet(eq_constraint=eq, box_constraint=box,
                                           hyperparameters=hyperparameters)

    model, params, train_step = build_model_and_train_step(
        rng_key=rng_key,
        dim=A.shape[2],
        features_list=hyperparameters["features_list"],
        activation=activation,
        project=project,                # projector in the training graph
        project_test=project_test,      # projector used at eval
        raw_train=hyperparameters.get("raw_train", False),
        raw_test=hyperparameters.get("raw_test", False),
        loss_fn=lambda preds, _b: batched_objective(preds),
        example_x=X[:1, :, 0],
        example_b=b[:1],
        jit=True,
    )
    return model, params, train_step
```

### Run the end-to-end script
To reproduce the results in the paper, you can run
```bash
python -m src.benchmarks.toy_MPC.run_toy_MPC --filename toy_MPC_seed42_examples10000.npz --config toy_MPC --seed 0
```
To generate the dataset, run
```bash
python -m src.benchmarks.toy_MPC.generate_toy_MPC
```

You’ll get:
- **Training logs** (loss, CV, timing),
- **Validation/Test** metrics incl. relative suboptimality & CV,
- **Saved params & results** ready to reload and plot trajectories.

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting**: All the objects in `pinet.dataclasses` offer a `validate` methods, which can be used to verify your inputs.

## Benchmarks 📈
Below, we summarize the performance gains of &Pi;net over state-of-the-art methods. We consider the following metrics:
- Relative Suboptimality ($\texttt{RS}$): The suboptimality of a candidate solution $\hat{y}$ compared to the optimal objective $J(y^{\star})$, computed by a high-accuracy solver.
- Constraint Violation ($\texttt{CV}$): Maximum violation ($\infty$-norm) of any constraint (equality and inequality). In practice, any solver achieving a $\texttt{CV}$ below $10^{-5}$ is considered to have high accuracy and there is little benefit to go below that. Instead, when methods have sufficiently low $\texttt{CV}$, having a low $\texttt{RS}$ is better.
- Learning curves: Progress on $\texttt{RS}$ and $\texttt{CV}$ over wall-clock time on the validation set.
- Single inference time: The time required to solve one instance at test time.
- Batch inference time: The time required to solve a batch of $1024$ instances at test time.

We report the results for an optimization problem with optimization variable of dimension $d$, $n_{\mathrm{eq}}$ equality and $n_{\mathrm{ineq}}$ inequality convex constraints and with a  non-convex objective. Here, we use a small and a large (in the parametric optimization sense) datasets $(d, n_{\mathrm{eq}}, n_{\mathrm{ineq}})  \in \{(100, 50, 50), (1000, 500, 500)\}$.

Overall, &Pi;net outperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and training times.
