"""Agent Service Guard backed by the shared guard infrastructure.

All core guard functionality (port allocation, process forking, health
checks, cleanup) is provided by ``areal.infra.rpc.guard``.  This module
creates and exposes the Flask app and shared state instance, following
the same pattern as ``areal.v2.inference_service.guard``.
